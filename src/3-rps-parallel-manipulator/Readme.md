Here is a detailed explanation of the extended code and its components:

1. **Imports and Definitions**:
    - The code imports the necessary libraries `AccelStepper` and `TMCStepper` for controlling the stepper motors.
    - Pin connections for enabling the stepper drivers and for the direction and step signals for three motors are defined.
    - Constants for the sense resistor value and the manipulator link lengths are specified.

2. **Driver and Stepper Initialization**:
    - Three instances of `TMC2209Stepper` are created for the TMC2209 stepper drivers.
    - Three instances of `AccelStepper` are created for controlling the stepper motors.

3. **Setup Function**:
    - Serial communication is initialized.
    - The enable pin for the drivers is set to output and enabled.
    - Each TMC2209 driver is initialized with specific configurations (e.g., current, microsteps).
    - Maximum speed and acceleration are set for each stepper motor.

4. **Inverse Kinematics Integration**:
    - A function `inverseKinematics` is defined to calculate joint angles (`theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`) based on the target end-effector position (`x`, `y`, `z`). This function currently contains placeholder calculations that need to be replaced with actual inverse kinematics calculations for the specific manipulator.
    - Another function `angleToSteps` converts the calculated joint angles to stepper motor steps. This function also contains placeholder logic that should be replaced with actual conversion logic based on the stepper motor configuration.

5. **Main Control Loop**:
    - In the `loop` function, target positions for the end-effector are specified.
    - The `inverseKinematics` function is called to get the joint angles for the given end-effector position.
    - The joint angles are converted to stepper motor positions using the `angleToSteps` function.
    - The stepper motors are then commanded to move to the calculated positions using `moveTo` and `run` methods from the `AccelStepper` library.

This code sets up the basic framework for controlling a 3-RPS parallel manipulator using inverse kinematics. The placeholder functions need to be replaced with accurate calculations based on the specific kinematics of your manipulator.
